# eLab-Lineage-Draw-Addon
This is the git repo for Extracellular's lineage draw addon, it's designed to allow users to simply draw a sample's lineage based on user requirements:

---

To get started you must:
1. Install NodeJS with a version >= 16
2. npm install http-server -g (can add sudo on the front)
3. Get OpenSSL, they ask for a specific version but I got a different one (check [here](https://developer.elabnext.com/docs/getting-started))
4. run to generate keys:
```
$ req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 10000 â€“nodes
```
5. then make start-up script executable:
```
chmod +x SDK-server.sh
```
6. And you can run the server with:
```
./SDK-server.sh
```

NOTE: ALSO MIGHT NEED TO GENERATE OWN GIT PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN
